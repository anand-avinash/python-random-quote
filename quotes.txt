Keep it logically awesome.
Mind your words, they are important.
Speak like a human.
Half measures are as bad as nothing at all.
Non-blocking is better than blocking.
Approachable is better than simple.
Practicality beats purity.
Avoid administrative distraction.
Encourage flow.
Anything added dilutes everything else.
